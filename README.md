# populateList

SharePoint List Populator
2016

Project description
-------------------
Using AngularJS, and SharePoint 2013 JSOM library, I created a simple company-internal tool to populate 
random but specifications-following per-field data for any SharePoint List. 
The app could figure out what rules of randomness could be set per field by reading the List definition, 
and propose a rule from an option set. 

A small video of the app is available here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwC2DYNwkOy9akd1VTB5VVhjRUE/
